Working through tutorials with my own twist


To go along with the Tuturials. I plan on adding some projects to the list. Here are a few areas I would like to explore with this data. 

Are the top Fantasy Basketball Scorers the most efficient in getting fantasy points? 

What makes a player more effective? Or better said, what can help deteremine a players performance more? Pace, Defence played againts, etc? 

Teams average FPTS allowed per position. 

Taking a step away from Fantasy pts, is there a most valuable position in basketball? Does having a top 5 center matter more than a top 5 point guard? 
This will take some more detail on what determines a top 5 player.
